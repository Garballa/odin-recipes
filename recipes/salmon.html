        Salmon and cedar go together like hot fudge on a sundae. Not only does
        the fish get imbued with the essence of cedar, but this technique is
        also easy, gentle, and health-conscious. We take this recipe to new
        heights by adding a tangy honey and grain mustard sauce, which is
        elevated further with a bit of rosemary and lemon. Is your mouth
        watering yet? Let's get started.

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      
      <ol class="paper">
        <li>Soak cedar grilling plank in water for 2 hours, keeping it immersed.</li>
        <li>Prepare grill for direct-heat cooking over medium-hot charcoal (medium-high heat for gas).</li>
          <li>Open vents on bottom and lid of charcoal grill.</li>
          <li>Stir together mustard, honey, rosemary, zest, and 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. 
            Spread mixture on flesh side of salmon and let stand at room temperature 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Put salmon on plank, skin side down (if salmon is too wide for plank,
               fold in thinner side to fit). Grill, covered with lid, until salmon is just cooked through and edges are browned,
                13 to 15 minutes. Let salmon stand on plank 5 minutes before serving.</li>
