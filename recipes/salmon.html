        Salmon and cedar go together like hot fudge on a sundae. Not only does
        the fish get imbued with the essence of cedar, but this technique is
        also easy, gentle, and health-conscious. We take this recipe to new
        heights by adding a tangy honey and grain mustard sauce, which is
        elevated further with a bit of rosemary and lemon. Is your mouth
        watering yet? Let's get started.
