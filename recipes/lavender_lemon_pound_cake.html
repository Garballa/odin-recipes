      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 325 F. Grease and flour a 12-cup Bundt cake pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cream butter with granulated sugar until light. Beat in eggs, one at a
          time, beating well after each addition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add about 1/3 of the flour
          mixture to the creamed mixture, along with half of the sour cream.
          Beat until well blended.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat with another 1/3 of the flour mixture and the remaining sour
          cream, scraping the sides of the bowl a few times. Beat in the
          remaining flour mixture until smooth and well blended.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fold in the 1 1/2 tablespoons of dried lavender flowers and the juice
          and zest of 2 lemons. Spoon into the prepared baking pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in center comes
          out clean.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Make the Glaze</h3>
      <hr class="header" />
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat lemon juice (juice of 1 lemon) and 2 teaspoons lavender flowers
          in the microwave or on the stovetop. (Note: Heat just until hot to
          bring out the lavender flavor a bit.)
        </li>
        <li>Strain out flowers; set juice aside and discard the flowers.</li>
        <li>
          In a bowl, combine the confectioners' sugar, hot lemon juice, and
          enough hot water to make a good drizzling consistency.
        </li>
        <li>Drizzle over the cooled (can be slightly warm) cake.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
